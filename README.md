# Curriculum Vitae TeX Template

- [Arquivo README em portuguÃªs](README_PT.md)

TeX template that I made for my personal CV.

# Features to be Implemented

- [ ] Automate numbers of line to jump in `about` variable and `createSection` function
- [ ] Frame user profile picture in a circle

# About the Template

To use it, you have to fill the `professional`, `age`, `address`, `phone`, `email` `date` and `about` variables, in the `Usage Changes` section, and add a profile picture. To create a section, use the `createSection` function, following the template's examples. Be aware of the numbers of lines to jump in `about` variable and `createSection` function.

Regarding the comments, I have a personal taste for this style (60 columns length and centralized text), I think it catches the user's attention.
